# Audiogroove-Music-Generation-using-AI
##Abstract


Recent years have seen a notable explosion in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), fueled by developments in deep learning and AI. Using cutting-edge AI models like LSTM and DCGAN's GAN, as well as different music representations like MelSpectrograms and Piano Rolls, this project takes use of this revolutionary wave to completely change the field of music production. Our objective is to remove the limitations that have historically impeded musical creativity, allowing for the quick and cohesive creation of multitrack songs in a variety of genres. The concept imagines a future in which artificial intelligence (AI) and human expertise coexist harmoniously, promoting a dynamic interaction between creative and technical innovation. Real-time communication between musicians and admirers is possible via an easy-to-use interface.

##Introduction


Traditional music development sometimes faces high expenses, time limits, and limited genre exploration. Our project uses LSTM and GAN to provide quick, coherent, and diversified multitrack generation, which we hope will revolutionize music production. It investigates the nexus between art and technology in the creation of music, where cutting-edge technologies like LSTM and GAN transform musical composition, production, and creativity.

##Methodology
